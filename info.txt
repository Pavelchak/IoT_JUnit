1.	Create some sample class. Write a test class for it that use:
•	different asserts
•	static final constant with package-private (default ) or protected access level
•	mocks and Mockito.verify
2.	Write tests for testing void methods, e.g. file creation (that is not unit test actually).
3.	Create test suite and run it.
